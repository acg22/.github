The geometry (model) is based on a typical triangle strip, and we periodically replace the coordinates of each vertex with the coordinates of the corresponding vertex of the polygon two previous, aligning the coordinates of the first two vertices with the position of the airplane.

We map UV vectors to the geometry as shown in Fig. 1 then shade it with the code in `createContrail.frag`.
