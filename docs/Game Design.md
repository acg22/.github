# Game Design
We need to make **contents** of the game, cut them into **small pieces**, and provide them **little by little**, spacing several minutes, hours or even days per a content.
The contents can be **anything**, such as 3D models, flavor text, game mechanics, etc. If they are **novel** and make players want to see the contents that hasn't been unlocked yet, the contents doesn't even need to make sense.
